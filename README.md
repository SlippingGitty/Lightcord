<h1 align="center">What is Lightcord, and why does it suck?</h1>

Lightcord is a standalone modification of the Discord application that packages BetterDiscord and other various hacks and doo-dads for customization. 

This sounds all well and good, but what you should also know is that it intentionally uses older components from previous Discord builds so that specific customization are still compatible, which can be a security risk for you the user. Because of this, some BetterDiscord plugin devs have intentionally crippled their works to deter you from using Lightcord. 

Lightcord is also stuck on an older version of BetterDiscord for licensing reasons, meaning most of your plugins probably wont work properly in the first place. Lightcord's advertised functionality either barely works anymore, or is limited to an extent. 

### I am a user of Lightcord, and it works perfectly fine for me. Why should I care? 

It's a free world! If you want to expose yourself to security risks, have at it. I probably sound like a crazy person to you, anyways.

### Lightcord automatically blocks Discord's trackers and "blurs my email"! If anything, I'm more safe using it.

Discord hides your email by default already now, and stand alone mods like Powercord and Goosemod have functionality which can "block trackers". Powercord and Goosemod also aren't the entire client, and work ontop of offical Discord builds.

### What about Glasscord? 

You don't need it. Weigh it against everything else mentioned here and consider what your priorities are.

 ### Mods that run ontop of Discord 

#### Goosemod

Goosemod has a built-in store and support for custom repositories. Goosemod also works along side other Discord mods, like the ones listed bellow. Easily in my personal opinion one of the most user-friendly, lightweight, and flexible Discord mods out there.

#### Powercord (DEAD PROJECT, DONT USE)

Powercord advertises itself to be a "lightweight mod focused on simplicity and performance". It supports plugins and themes. There is also a [plugin that allows you to use BetterDiscord plugins with it.](https://github.com/Juby210/bdCompat)

#### BetterDiscord

BetterDiscord advertises itself as a modification for Discord that "allows you to add plugins and themes to your personal copy of Discord" and "adds a number of other features out of the box". BetterDiscord is what Lightcord uses for themes and plugins, albiet an older version.

#### BeautifulDiscord

Lets you inject a .css file for themeing. If this is all you need, this works just as well as advertised.

### Mods which use the web version of Discord

#### Armcord 

As of now, it pretty much just the web version of Discord but it packages Goosemod for Chrome with it.

#### Goosemod for Chrome

It's Goosemod but for Chrome :p

Feel free to send corrections. I would like to note that I don't hate anyone involved with Lightcord except maybe Phorcys, he's kinda sus ngl.
